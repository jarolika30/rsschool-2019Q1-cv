	I have recently finished my second education, now I am looking for a good start for my career in IT.  
	My main interest is to develop my skills in Web-technologies. On my opinion this area plays leading 
position in the modern development. It`s developing fast and opens good jobs perspective.  
	My professional background was connected with teaching. I think, that my previous job helped me to get 
such important skills as patience, responsibility and although  not to be afraid of any difficulties. 
In addition I can teach others and learn by myself. Live and learn - it's about me. I like to face new challenges 
and to get new skillset.
