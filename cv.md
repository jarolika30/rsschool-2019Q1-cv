**My goal**: to obtain a Front-end Developer position.  
```
	I have recently finished my second education, now I am looking for a good start for 
my career in IT.  
	My main interest is to develop my skills in Web technologies. I like it, because
Web technologies offer powerful possibilities to make websites, web applications, games
and it is the best way to implement my ideas and dreams. Among a large numbers of programming  
languages I prefer JavaScript. It allows not only to create beautiful and interactive projects, 
but also can be used on the server side.
	At the moment I am familiar with NodeJS, Sass, JQuery, I made some projects using them. I 
want to develop  in this area and to be able to write code better and more efficiently.
	My professional background was connected with teaching. I think, that my previous job helped 
me to get such important skills as patience, responsibility and although  not to be afraid of any 
difficulties. In addition I can teach others and learn by myself. I think, it is very important 
for an IT-specialist to be a quick learner. Live and learn - it's about me. I like to face new challenges  
and to get new skill set.
	Now I am ready to work hard and to spend much time to become a good specialist in Web Development.
